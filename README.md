# E-Commerce Supply Chain Analysis: On-Time Delivery Prediction

## Project Overview : 
This project aims to analyze an international e-commerce company's supply chain to predict whether products reach customers on time. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we gain insights into delivery patterns, optimize logistics, and enhance customer satisfaction.

## Objective :
 - Gain insights from e-commerce delivery data.
 - Build an effective predictive model to improve supply chain efficiency.
 - Help the company increase profitability by reducing late deliveries.

## Dataset : 
The dataset contains 10,999 observations and 12 variables, including:
 - Warehouse block: Location of storage before shipping.
 - Mode of shipment: Transportation method (e.g., ship, flight, road).
 - Customer rating: Satisfaction score from customers.
 - Cost of the product: Price details for different products.
 - Prior purchases: Number of previous transactions by the customer.
 - On-time delivery status: Target variable indicating if the product arrived on time.

## Technologies Used : 
 - Python 
 - Pandas, NumPy – Data manipulation
 - Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization
 - Scikit-learn – Model building
 - XGBoost, KNN, GridSearchCV – Machine learning models

## Key Insights :
 - Data exploration revealed trends in delivery delays based on shipment mode and warehouse location.
 - Feature engineering helped improve model performance.
 - The XGBoost classifier provided the best accuracy in predicting late deliveries.

## Results & Impact : 
 - Improved on-time delivery prediction accuracy.
 - Identified key factors affecting late deliveries.
 - Provided data-driven insights to enhance logistics efficiency.
